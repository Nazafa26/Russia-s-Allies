In this project, we show how to clean data and do visualization in Jupyter note book. Matplotlib and Seaborn are python libraries that are used for data visualization. They have inbuilt modules for plotting different graphs. While Tableau has a full capacity for the graphs and data visualization, but you can also use python libraries in some extended capacity. While Matplotlib is used to embed graphs into applications, Seaborn is primarily used for statistical graphs.
